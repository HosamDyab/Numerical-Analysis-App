## üß™ Methods Implementation

### Root-Finding Methods

Each method implements a different approach to finding roots of nonlinear equations:

| Method | Description | Order of Convergence |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| Bisection | Divides interval in half at each step | Linear |
| False Position | Uses secant line for better approximation | Linear (faster than bisection) |
| Fixed Point | Iterates function until convergence | Linear or higher (depends on g(x)) |
| Newton-Raphson | Uses derivatives for rapid convergence | Quadratic |
| Secant | Two-point derivative approximation | ~1.62 (superlinear) |

### Linear System Solvers

Our application implements various methods for solving systems of linear equations:

- Direct methods that provide exact solutions (within floating-point precision)
- Options with partial pivoting for enhanced numerical stability
- Clear visualization of the solution process

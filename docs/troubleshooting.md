# Troubleshooting

This guide provides solutions for common issues you might encounter while using the Numerical Analysis Application.

## Installation Issues

### Missing Dependencies

**Problem:** Error message about missing dependencies when launching the application.

**Solution:**
1. Ensure you have installed all required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. If that doesn't work, try installing packages individually:
   ```bash
   pip install customtkinter==5.2.1 sympy==1.12 numpy==1.24.3 matplotlib==3.7.1 reportlab==4.0.4 pillow==10.0.0 scipy==1.11.1
   ```

3. Check your Python version (should be 3.8 or higher):
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

### SciPy Installation Issues

**Problem:** Errors when installing SciPy.

**Solution:**
1. On Windows, try using a pre-built wheel:
   ```bash
   pip install --only-binary :all: scipy
   ```

2. On Linux, ensure you have development packages installed:
   ```bash
   # Debian/Ubuntu
   sudo apt-get install python3-dev libatlas-base-dev
   
   # RHEL/CentOS/Fedora
   sudo dnf install python3-devel atlas-devel
   ```

## Application Startup Issues

### Application Freezes on Startup

**Problem:** Application freezes or crashes during startup.

3. Ensure your display supports the required resolution (minimum 800x600).

### Display Scaling Issues

**Problem:** Text and UI elements appear too small or too large.

**Solution:**
1. The application automatically adjusts scaling for high-DPI displays, but may not be perfect.

2. Run in lightweight mode to skip some scaling adjustments:
   ```bash
   python main.py --light
   ```

3. If problems persist, adjust your system's display scaling settings.

## Calculation Issues

### Method Doesn't Converge

**Problem:** Calculation doesn't converge or gives "Maximum iterations reached" message.

**Solution:**
1. Increase the maximum iterations in Settings.

2. Try a different numerical method that may be better suited to your problem:
   - For oscillating functions, try Bisection instead of Newton-Raphson
   - For slow convergence, try Newton-Raphson instead of Bisection

3. Check your initial values:
   - For Bisection/False Position: ensure f(a) and f(b) have opposite signs
   - For Newton-Raphson: start closer to the expected root
   - For Secant: use two points that bracket the root

### Incorrect Results

**Problem:** Method gives unexpected or incorrect results.

**Solution:**
1. Verify your function input syntax:
   - Use `*` for multiplication: `2*x` not `2x`
   - Use `**` or `^` for exponents: `x**2` or `x^2`
   - Use proper function calls: `sin(x)` not `sinx`

2. Increase decimal places in Settings for more precision.

3. Try a more stable method:
   - Bisection is most reliable but slower
   - Gauss Elimination with Partial Pivoting is more stable than regular Gauss Elimination

### Function Parsing Errors

**Problem:** "Error parsing function" or similar message.

**Solution:**
1. Check function syntax:
   ```
   # Correct:
   x^2 - 4
   sin(x) + cos(x)
   
   # Incorrect:
   x² - 4
   sinx + cosx
   ```

2. Ensure you're using supported functions and operators.

3. For complex expressions, try breaking them down into simpler parts.

## Plot Issues

### Plot Not Appearing

**Problem:** Function plot is not displayed.

**Solution:**
1. Verify your function can be plotted (some functions have discontinuities or asymptotes).

2. For matrix methods, plots are not generated by design.

3. Restart the application if matplotlib is having issues.

### Plot Shows Incorrect Range

**Problem:** Plot doesn't show the interesting part of the function.

**Solution:**
1. The application automatically sets the plot range based on the root value.

2. If the auto-range is not satisfactory, try using a method that converges to a point in your area of interest.

## Export Issues

### PDF Export Fails

**Problem:** Cannot export results to PDF.

**Solution:**
1. Ensure you have ReportLab properly installed:
   ```bash
   pip install reportlab==4.0.4
   ```

2. Check write permissions in your current directory.

3. Try specifying a different output location with full path.

## Application Performance

### Slow Calculations

**Problem:** Calculations take too long.

**Solution:**
1. For complex functions, use Newton-Raphson or Secant methods instead of Bisection.

2. For large matrices, ensure you have sufficient RAM.

3. Run in lightweight mode to reduce UI overhead:
   ```bash
   python main.py --light
   ```

### High Memory Usage

**Problem:** Application uses excessive memory.

**Solution:**
1. Close other applications to free up system resources.

2. For matrix operations, use LU Decomposition which is more memory-efficient.

3. Restart the application periodically during long sessions.

## Common Error Messages

### "Invalid syntax in function"

**Solution:** Check your mathematical expression for proper syntax. Remember to use operators (`*`, `/`, `^` or `**`) and parentheses appropriately.

### "No root in the given interval"

**Solution:** For Bisection and False Position methods, ensure your initial interval [a, b] has function values with opposite signs (f(a) and f(b) should have different signs).

### "Singular matrix encountered"

**Solution:** For matrix methods, your system of equations may be singular (no unique solution). Try a different method or check your input.

### "Maximum iterations reached"

**Solution:** Increase the maximum iterations in Settings, or try a different method with better convergence properties.

## Still Having Problems?

If you continue to experience issues:

1. Check the full application log file:
   ```
   ~/.numerical_analysis_app/app.log
   ```

2. Try resetting application settings:
   - Go to Settings → Reset to Defaults

3. Reinstall the application from scratch:
   ```bash
   pip uninstall -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Report the issue on GitHub with:
   - Description of the problem
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Your operating system and Python version
   - Application log file
